The Holonomic Movement is a types of Robot Movement  that can be using the benefits of Mecanum Wheels so the robot can move in every posible direction.

The program also has a PID Controller which helps the movements to be more efficient and precise. So that when ever the robot move it can move straight in the direction. 

The PID Controller is used to calculate the sum of the difference of the current value, the setpoint which the user has set and the passed value. So the PID will control the amount of the electricity that is needs to increase of decrease using the error value
